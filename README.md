## Tips and tricks

- Write your answers after the questions.

for example for java code:

```text
  `` `java
  Your Java code should come here
  `` `
```

- Before starting to write anything you should read through all the questions.

### Short questions

Depends on the question but keep it around 2-3 sentences.
